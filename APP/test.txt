BUT, I do highly recommend the scotch eggs.

Staff is very friendly and food is delicious.

They charge $4 to substitute homemade chips with fries. The normal side order of fries is $5, so this is RIDICULOUS! 

The food is pretty average. I tried the sour cream chicken enchiladas and had a fairly bland mixture. The mixed vegetables were a little different and filling so I upgraded from the 2 stars I planned.

Horrible service! Their delivery driver whose name is apparently Wendy according to their cashier showed up at my door and when I asked how she was doing she went off on a rant about how horrible people are and how everyone should tip since she is "wasting" her gas for them....as if she doesn't get paid at this job....and straight up told me that I should be cooking my own dinner if I can't afford to tip.
