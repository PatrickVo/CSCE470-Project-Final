For the Algorithm Datacheck point - We broke the yelp data into json files each categories by their star rating. 
The json files have also been removed of stop words and stemmed. You can check our makejson.py file on how we did this. 
These json files help make it easier for us to run our algorithm on the data to find the similar. To run our code here are 3 easy steps. 

1. Download the Github files.
2. After words run the algorithm.py file. (the only files required are the star json files included on github)
3. This code is not optimized and will take about 3-5 mins to run.
